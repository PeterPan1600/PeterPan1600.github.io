        <p class="indented">Hello there! It’s <span class="headtitle">Peter Pagasartonga</span>, a 23-year-old student and studies IT as a Sophomore at PHINMA University of Pangasinan.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">I've looked for opportunities to use and hone my talents through practical projects and work experiences throughout my academic career.
            I think that gaining practical experience is essential for career advancement.
            Whether creating the assigned projects or working to improve myself, I give everything I have to make sure that whatever I do is a true reflection of my commitment and dedication.
